# SAR-Image-Despeckling-Using-CNN-
An implementation of the paper SAR Image Despeckling Using a Convolutional Neural Network by Puyang Wang Using Tensorflow and keras ,<br />
The paper link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8053792 <br />
I only trained the model for 20 epochs on images of size 64x64 <br />
Here is my run on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/javidtheimmortal/sar-image-despeckling-using-a-convolutional-neural <br />
